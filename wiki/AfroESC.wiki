= MikroKopter I2C assignment =

Default firmware ships for motor #1 only. User needs to build and flash firmware for other motor index.

Set I2C_ADDR to 0x50 (default motor start number I think??).
Then change MOTOR_ID to 0, 1, 2, 3,... etc to match motor index, rebuild firmware, and flash afro_nfet.hex using USB linker.

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE STILL NOT TESTED!!! Follow at your own risk.
I2C_ADDR might need to be 0x52, and MOTOR_ID might need to start from 1, not 0. Try both if original instructions fail.
