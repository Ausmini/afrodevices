#summary Hardware details for rev2 board

rev1 fixed some design omissions in rev0, but was never manufactured.
rev2 accepted the OpenPilot PCB dimensions of 36x36mm with 30.5mm mounting holes. This will be the final production version.

Slightly larger board size allowed to place label silkscreen on top side of the board only, easing user assembly and testing.
