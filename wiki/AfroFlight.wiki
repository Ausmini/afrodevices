#summary STM8S-based simple multirotor flight controller.

= Introduction =

Simple, small, fun flight controller. Currently works in rate (heading hold) mode, attitude (hover, auto-level) to be added later.

== Hardware ==

  * STM8S105 CPU (8bit CISC, 16MHz)
  * Invensense IDG500 / ISZ500 Gyro
  * Analog ADXL345 digital SPI accelerometer
  * PPM (up to 12 channels) RC input
  * PWM (50..450Hz) motor output for up to 6 motors
  * I2C header for possible expansion or motor control
  * UART (firmware update, telemetry)
  * Battery voltage monitoring and low-voltage alarm
  * Buzzer for alarm/user notification
  * Status LED

== Status ==

It works.
