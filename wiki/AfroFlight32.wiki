#summary STM32F103-based simple multirotor flight controller.

= Introduction =

Simple, small, fun flight controller. 
Two available firmware choices:

  # MultiWii-dev port to STM32 ("baseflight" in SVN)
  # Chinese 'FreeFlight' firmware. Autolevel/gyro, limited functionality.

== Hardware ==

  * STM32F103C8T6 CPU (32bit ARM Cortex M3, 72MHz)
  * Invensense MPU3050 3-axis gyro
  * Analog ADXL345 digital accelerometer
  * Honeywell HMC5883L digital compass
  * Bosch-Sensortec BMP085 pressure sensor
  * 6 + 8 PWM I/O can remap as input or output for RC/PPM/Motors/Servos
  * PPM (up to 12 channels) RC input
  * 8 channel PWM RC input
  * PWM (50..450Hz) motor output for up to 6 motors
  * Onboard USB connector for telemetry and firmware update
  * Battery voltage monitoring and low-voltage alarm
  * Buzzer for alarm/user notification
  * Status LEDs

== Status ==

It works.

== Board revisions ==
