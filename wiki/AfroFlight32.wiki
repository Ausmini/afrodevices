#summary STM32F103-based simple multirotor flight controller.

= Introduction =

Simple, small, fun flight controller. 
Several available firmware choices:

  # MultiWii-dev port to STM32 ("baseflight" in SVN)
  # Written from scratch "correct" firmware using various attitude estimators, Kalman filtering, etc ("baseflightplus" in SVN)
  # Chinese 'FreeFlight' firmware. Autolevel/gyro, limited functionality. Supported on rev0 to rev3 hardware. Not supported on rev4 hardware.

== Hardware ==

  * 36x36mm 2 layer pcb, 30.5mm mounting pattern
  * STM32F103CxT6 CPU (32bit ARM Cortex M3, 72MHz, 64K/128K flash. Pin compatible with upcoming STM32F3 Cortex M4)
  * Invensense MPU3050 3-axis gyro (rev0 to rev3)
  * Invensense MPU6050 3-axis gyro (rev4)
  * Analog ADXL345 digital accelerometer (rev0 to rev3, removed in rev4)
  * FreeScale MMA8452Q digital accelerometer (rev3 to rev4)
  * Honeywell HMC5883L digital compass
  * Bosch-Sensortec BMP085 pressure sensor (rev0 to rev3, removed in rev4)
  * MEAS-SPEC MS5611-01BA03 pressure sensor (rev4)
  * 6 + 8 PWM I/O can remap as input or output for RC/CPPM/Motors/Servos
  * second UART accessible for Spektrum Satellite RX or GPS
  * CPPM (up to 12 channels) RC input
  * 8 channel standard PWM RC input
  * PWM (50..1kHz) motor output for up to 6 motors, can be remapped with other pins for 8 motors + camera stabilization
  * Onboard USB connector for telemetry and firmware update
  * Battery voltage monitoring and low-voltage alarm
  * Buzzer for alarm/user notification
  * Status LEDs

== Status ==

It works.
